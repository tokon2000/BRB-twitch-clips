This is a HTML/JS project that will show the top overall and top most recent clips of a twitch channel.

## Prerequisities
- Go to the [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps), click the purple `Register Your Application` button.
- Give your application a unique name, write `http://localhost` in the `OAuth Redirect URLs` field, select a category, You could just use `Application Integration`.
- Click `Create`, afterwards it will bring you back to your application list, click on the `Manage` button.
- Once you are in the `Manage Application` section you will see a couple new things, `Client ID` and a `New Secret` button, click it
  and you will get a `Client Secret`.

    - Optional: Change the width and height to best suit your needs, I prefer the 16:9 ratio, 1280x720, 1920x1080 etc..
-   Once added it should start playing your clips, now all that is left to do is make it work with your scene.
